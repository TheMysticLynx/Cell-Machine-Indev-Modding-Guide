First head to your install of Cell Machine Indev and locate the `Resources/Data/Managed` folder. You will need to reference `IndevModdingInterface.dll` and `UnityEngine.dll` to get type completion in your IDE. Make sure you have the proper version of .NET installed (4.8).

You will also need an IDE, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

For a great base head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cell-machine-791818283867045941) and go to `modding-resources` channel. There you can download the code used in the game for standard cells. To download, click green `Code` button, and then click "Download ZIP". You can also click "Open in Visual Studio" if you are using that IDE.

This will be our base. Open your IDE, and create a new class library C# solution using .NET 4.8. Next, paste in your mod base.

Find your References button. (in VS, it is in `Solution Explorer`)

You will need to have 2 references - `UnityEngine` and `IndevModdingInterface`. You *should* have them, but if you don't, click "Add Reference", then you can add them either by directly specifying from `Resources/Data/Managed` folder, or using a NuGet `Indev.NET` package.

Now you're ready to setup the `IMod` interface.

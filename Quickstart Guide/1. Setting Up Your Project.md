First head to your install of Cell Machine Indev and locate the `Resources/Data/Managed` folder.  You will need to reference `IndevModdingInterface.dll` and `UnityEngine.dll` to get type completion in your IDE.  Make sure you have the proper version of .NET installed.

For a great base head over to our [discord](https://discord.gg/cell-machine-791818283867045941) and check the `mod-base` channel. There you can download the code used in the game for standard cells. This will be our base. Create a new C# solution using .NET 4.8. Next, past in your mod base.

Now you're ready to setup the `IMod` interface.

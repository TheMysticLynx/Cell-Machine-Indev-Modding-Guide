Texture variants allow you to swap a cells sprite during runtime. 

To get started first make your base texture. Name all variants for the texture in the following format: 
`Name.png, Name1.png, Name2.png etc.`
Save these files in your mods Texture folder like normal.

To use one of the variants, simply set a `BasicCell`s `SpriteVariant` to the number corrosponding with the proper offset.

All names must be sequential, the base texture must not end with a texture.

Now that you've made your mod, lets export it and it's textures.

First things first, build your project. (it is usually a button on the top of your IDE)

Then, head over to your [applicationPersistantDataPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html). (`%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\KaidenHoward\CellMachineIndev` on Windows)

Go to `Mods`, and create a new folder, matching your dll name.

Place the compiled DLL into that new folder. If you'd like to include additional textures with your mod (can be overwritten by texture packs), include a `Textures` folder with every texture you'd like to use.

You have now installed your mod into the game. Open Indev, head to the mods tab, and enable your mod, then test it. If there have been any errors, you will be able to find then in `ModErrors.txt` file. If you need to debug something, you can use `Debug.Log`s - console output is stored in `Player.log` file.

After you confirmed everything is perfect, zip your mod: include your .dll and `Textures` folder.

It may look a little something like:
```
TroverMod.zip
  ┖ TroverMod.dll
  ┖ Textures
     ┖ Trover.png
```

To create a basic cell with no step behaviour simply derive from the `CellProcessor` class. A cell processor is responsible for controlling push behaviour, and update behaviour for cells of a certain type. Every cell is represented by a `BasicCell`
```
//Holds information about cell type and ID for debugging
public Instance Instance { get; }  
//Holds a reference to the cell grid this cell is placed in
public ICellGrid? ParentCellGrid { get; set; }  
//Holds position and rotation
public CellTransform Transform { get; set; }  
//Used for animation
public CellTransform PreviousTransform { get; set; }
```

Let's look at a example of a basic cell processor (push cell).
```
public class BasicCellProcessor : CellProcessor  
{  
	//Name displayed ingame
    public override string Name => "Basic Cell";  
    //Every cell must have a unique and sequential ID
    public override int CellType => 0;  
    //This is the name used to grab the sprite from textures resources and texture packs.
    public override string CellSpriteIndex => "Basic";  
  
	//Calling base constructure with cellGrid gives us access to the cell grid
    public BasicCellProcessor(ICellGrid cellGrid) : base(cellGrid)  
    {  
    }  

	//Called when a cell is pushed to see if it should move
    public override bool TryPush(BasicCell cell, Direction direction, int force)  
    {  
	    //This number is reduced by 1 everytime a mover facing the opposite direction is pushed.
        if (force <= 0)  
            return false;  

		//Get the position we want to move to
        var target = cell.Transform.Position + direction.AsVector2Int; 

		//If it's out of bounds return false and don't move
        if (!_cellGrid.InBounds(target))  
            return false;  

		//Target is in bounds, check if there's a cell in the way
        var targetCell = _cellGrid.GetCell(target);  

		//If no cell is in the way we are free to move
        if (targetCell is null)  
        {  
            cell.Move(target);  
            return true;        
        }  

		//Otherwise see if we can push the cell out of the way
        if (!_cellGrid.PushCell(targetCell.Value, direction, force))  
            return false;  
  

		//We where able to push the cell out of the way, move.
        cell.Move(target);  
        return true;    
    }  

	//Called when a cell attempts to replace this cell. Normally this can't happen, see trash cell for use cases.
    public override bool OnReplaced(BasicCell basicCell, BasicCell replacingCell)  
    {  
        return true;  
    }  

	//Called when cell is created
    public override void OnCellInit(ref BasicCell cell)  
    {  
        //do nothing  
    }  

	//Called when cell grid is cleared
    public override void Clear()  
    {  
        //do nothing  
    }  
}
```
